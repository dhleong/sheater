*Character sheets so good it'll feel like cheating*

## What?

Sheater is a free web app that supports customizable, dynamic
character sheets for tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons
or FantasyAGE. Your sheets are stored in the cloud (on your
Google Drive) so you can load them up on any device with a screen
and access to the internet.

## How?

Sheater uses a [hiccup][1]-like language to declare templates.
Each template has a "static" section, in which you can include
raw data such as attributes or spell lists that can be referenced
in the rest of the template; one or more page definitions; and,
of course, a user data section. For more information, and to learn
about how to make your own template, see the
[templates documentation][2].
